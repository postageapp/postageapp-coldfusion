##PostageApp for ColdFusion

### Setup

To begin using the ColdFusion wrapper for PostageApp, add the ColdFusion component to your project. There is an example .cfm that highlights some of the usage of the supported API methods. Note: Currently only the `send_message` endpoint is implemented.

### Documentation

For additional documentation on the PostageApp API refer to the [PostageApp API Documentation Page](http://help.postageapp.com/kb/api/api-overview)

### Authors

Big thanks to [Sami Hoda](http://bytestopshere.wordpress.com/) for the original implementation of the ColdFusion wrapper.
